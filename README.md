### Notes
This project can use alot of work, mainly:
1. We could integrate the NRF24L01+ into the PCB boards.
2. Add the components of the Micolipo into the main transmitter PCB Board.
3. Translate the assembly code into arduino code to allow the use of smaller micro comtrollers and possibly 2 way communication.

## Getting Started
